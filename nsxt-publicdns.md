Here, the Goal is to let VMware SDDC workloads running on the NSX-T Overlay networks to access the Public DNS servers out of the OCVS SDDC environment.

For the below configuration and example, we will use the well-known Google DNS Server ip :8.8.8.8.

We will be configuring DNS forwarding on NSX-T to allow SDDC VMs to forward their DNS queries to Google DNS servers.
